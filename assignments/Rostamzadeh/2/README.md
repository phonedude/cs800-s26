## Academic Webpage

I have created a professional academic webpage that serves as the central hub for my academic and professional online presence.
The webpage includes my role as a PhD student in the Computer Science Department at Old Dominion University, my email address, and links to my Google Scholar, ORCID, LinkedIn, and GitHub profiles.

Academic webpage:
https://student.wp.odu.edu/mrost004/
-WEBPAGE-URL

ODU CS redirect:
https://www.cs.odu.edu/~cs_mrost004/

The webpage uses a clean layout with a modest use of color and visual elements to
ensure a professional and visually appealing presentation. Screenshots of the webpage and the working redirect are included in the repository.



## Latex

LaTeX and Overleaf

I created an Overleaf account and completed Part 1 of the LaTeX introduction as required. Using the template provided in class (slide 65), I replaced the placeholder text, URLs, and images with my own information, including my name, affiliation, email address, and links to my academic profiles.

The latex/ directory contains:

[LaTeX Basics (PDF)](latex/latex_basics.pdf)


The compiled PDF generated from Overleaf, demonstrating successful use of LaTeX and completion of the required template customization.

This PDF was downloaded directly from Overleaf and is included here as part of the Assignment 2 submission.
