# Assignment 3: Reading Papers

**CS 800 Research Methods, Spring 2026**

## Description

This assignment involves finding and performing Keshav's 1st pass on five papers related to my research interests in graph neural networks, graph homomorphism, and expressive power of GNNs. For each paper, the 1st pass identifies the **problem**, **approach**, and **contributions** from the title, abstract, introduction, section headings, and conclusion.
