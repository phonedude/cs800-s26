# Assignment 2, Presence, Tools, RCR
## CS 800 Research Methods, Spring 2026

Due: 2026-02-09

Points available: 10

## Professional Presence

You will be creating multiple online accounts and webpages.  Include links to all of these accounts and/or pages in your Markdown report.  For your academic webpage, also include links to any webpages you used as inspiration.  

For all of the accounts you create, fill out your bio and include an appropriate profile picture. If you already have an account made and are fine with it being your professional account, you do not need to create an additional one. Remember that all of these accounts are expressions of your professional online presence, so you should be comfortable sharing with a potential employer.

There should be some linkage from each of these accounts to the others.  For example, if someone finds your home page, they should be able to discover all of these other accounts. Where possible, provide bi-directional linkage.  

**Google Scholar**   
Create an account on Google Scholar.  If you do not have any publications, you can create a "fake" publication to get you started and then manually delete it later.  See https://scholar.google.com/intl/en/scholar/citations.html for information on how to create and account and how to add and delete publications (choose "skip for now" if you haven not yet authored any publications).  
Start following ODU CS faculty ([faculty list](https://odu.edu/compsci/directory)). Identify and follow at least 5 additional scholars in your research area. You should continue identifying and following researchers throughout the semester (and your academic career).  List the faculty that you're now following in your report.

**ORCID**  
Create an ORCID.

**LinkedIn**  
Create a LinkedIn account.

**Academic Webpage**   
Create an academic webpage. You should include elements that we have discussed in class, including your email address and links to the other accounts you have created above. The goal of this webpage is to show off your role within the CS Department and the profession. There should be some effort to include (reasonable) use of color and visual elements. That is, your webpage should be visually appealing and professional. 

You may host this webpage wherever you wish, but ht<span>tps://</span>w<span>ww.cs</span>.odu.edu/~*CSusername*/ should redirect to that webpage so that your page can easily be discovered. The Systems Group webpage on [Web Services](https://systems.cs.odu.edu/Web_Services) provides information on how to do this.

## LaTeX and Overleaf

LaTeX is *the* markup language for academic publication. [Overleaf](https://overleaf.com) provides an online setup for writing and compiling LaTeX into PDF.  

Sign up for a free [Overleaf](https://overleaf.com) account.

Walk through [part 1](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Free_online_introduction_to_LaTeX_(part_1)) of this [LaTeX introduction](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Free_online_introduction_to_LaTeX_(part_1)). In Overleaf, work the Typesetting Exercise 1 on [slide 65](https://www.overleaf.com/read/wdpmbwqbrzpm).  Download the PDF and include it in your A2 submission.

## Responsible Conduct of Research

All graduate students must complete the Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) training before completing 12 credit hours of graduate work. Read the information at https://www.odu.edu/impact/responsible-conduct-of-training and follow the instructions to complete your RCR training.  The "Responsible Conduct of Research for Engineers" option is the most applicable for CS.

Once you have completed all the required modules, you will be able to print out and/or take a screenshot of a completion certificate on the "CITI RCR Course Completion Page".

If you have previously completed the RCR training at ODU, you should have an indication of this in [Degree Works](https://degree.odu.edu) under "Doctoral Milestones". Take a screenshot of the RCR requirement and checkmark.

Upload the image/screenshot of your certificate or a screenshot of the RCR completion in DegreeWorks to your GitHub repo.  
 

### Submission

* Create a README.md that contains:
  * A description of the assignment, directories, files, links, etc.
  * Screen shots of relevant portions of your accounts, RCR completion, etc. 
  * A link to a Youtube video showing you walk through and narrate the various accounts, tools, RCR, etc.

Again, look at [Nelson/1](Nelson/1) for a template.
