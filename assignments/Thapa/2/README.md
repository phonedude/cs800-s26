In this assignment, I got familiar about some of the online platforms that are necessary for professional presence like **Google Scholar**, **ORCID** and **LinkedIn**. I created an account for each of these platforms and included that in my academic webpage. In addition to that, I completed the **LaTeX** task, and obtained the certification for **Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR)** training. The PDF obtained from the **LaTeX** and the certificate of completion of **RCR** training is attached under the directory **2** to this github. So, all the necessary files for this assignment are present inside the directory **2**.

The visual output for the works that I have done are shown below:

I tried to verify my ODU email here, but haven't received the email yet from google. So, I will try that again.
