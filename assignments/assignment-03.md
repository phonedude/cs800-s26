# Assignment 3, Reading Papers
## CS 800 Research Methods, Spring 2026

Due: 2026-02-23

Points available: 10

Find five papers in your research area that are related to your interests.  Talk to your PhD advisor (if in doubt, talk to me) and get recommendations.  Perform [Keshav's 1st pass](http://blizzard.cs.uwaterloo.ca/keshav/home/Papers/data/07/paper-reading.pdf) on each paper and identify its problem, approach, and contributions.

Your submission will contain:
* reference line (as it might appear in a list of references)
* link to the paper's DOI (if available; note that they're almost always available)
* appropriately edited BibTeX entry formatted as a [fenced code block](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks) (use ` ```bibtex ` for syntax highlighting)

You must include a marked-up PDF of each paper in your GitHub repo.  The markings can be done by hand and scanned in or made using Acrobat or another PDF markup tool.  The markings (e.g., highlights, boxes, text) should clearly identify the problem, approach, and contributions found in the sections you read.

### Submission

* Create a README.md that contains:
  * A description of the assignment, directories, files, links, etc.
  * Screen shots / images of page 1 of the papers.
  * A directory with the marked-up pdfs of the papers 
  * A link to a Youtube video showing you walk through the papers and discussing your 1st pass highlights.

Again, look at [Nelson/1](Nelson/1) for a template.
