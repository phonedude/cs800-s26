## Assignment

Pick a paper from A3 and/or A4.  Pick a paper that cites that paper, in a substantive way (e.g., it builds on it, extends it, refutes it).. Prepare a 10 minute presentation on the pair of papers that you will present in class.  Stress the relationship between the two papers: why did the second paper cite that first paper?

 Submission

* Create a README.md that contains:
  * A description of the assignment, directories, files, links, etc.
  * bibtex entries for the two papers.
  * A summary of the relationship of the two papers.
  * The link to the Google Slides presentation.
